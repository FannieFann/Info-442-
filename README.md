## Problem Statement:
With the development of city touring, traveling has become part of people’s daily life. They travel all over the world to see and experience. Besides, there are always needs for gifts and souvenirs to bring to their beloved ones, trying to let them feel the wonderful experience and culture on the road as well. From city t-shirts to local cuisine, it seems that there are lots of choices absolutely perfect as gifts. However, it’s really hard for tourists or even new coming residents to find those good gifts and souvenirs. They have no idea what the local specials are and where to get them. Most travellers just buy something randomly without ensured qualities when visiting tourist spots. As a result, selecting and buying souvenirs do become a problem for those travellers.

## Revised Problem Statment
Seattle attracts numerous tourists every year. In the limited visiting time, tourists need to figure out what Seattle specialties are, select meaningful gifts for their friends and family, find where to buy them and search for operation hours of stores. So far, there is no one single collaborative source of information. It takes effort and time for tourists to do the research online. Existing solutions are either product-oriented or store-oriented. For instance, Yelp provides store information and shop categories but it doesn’t provide product information. Some other traveling articles have the top souvenir recommendations in Seattle. People need to cross check various references and gather the information by themselves. This is a problem reducing their precious visiting time.
